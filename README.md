**GANImputer**\
This is the code of a novel missing data imputation algorithm based on Generative Adversarial Network(GAN).\
The algorithm contains three step:\
Step 1: Optimization of generator.\
Step 2: Optimization of latent space while keeping the optimized generator in step 1 fixed.\
Step 3: Fine-tuning of the genrator and the latent space at the same time.\
Details of the algorithm can be found in the paper.
